  "description": "Creates good-enough battlemaps based off of simple scribbles. Characters pick a fight with a random owlbear? Confront a noble on the road instead of in their castle as you'd planned? Rather than tossing up the same forest path map as always, make a new one, add a river, a bridge, and a fork in the road, all with a few scribbles of the drawing tool.",
